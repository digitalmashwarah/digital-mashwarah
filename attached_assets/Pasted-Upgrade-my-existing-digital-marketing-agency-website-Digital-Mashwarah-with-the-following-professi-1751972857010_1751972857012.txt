Upgrade my existing digital marketing agency website "Digital Mashwarah" with the following professional improvements. The current website already has a blue theme, moving elements, service sections, testimonials, team, blog, and contact.

Now add these advanced improvements:

1. **Sticky Navigation Bar:**
   - Make the top navbar sticky with a white background on scroll and soft shadow.

   - Optional: Add a short video background loop related to digital marketing.
   - Show logos of trusted platforms (e.g. Google, Meta, Instagram) below CTA button.

3. **Team Section Enhancement:**
   - Add hover effect to show short quotes or specialties of each team member (do not add LinkedIn icons).

4. **Portfolio Section Improvement:**
   - Make each portfolio card clickable.
   - On click, open a modal showing: client name, challenge, solution, tools used, and result.
   - Add client logos under the portfolio grid.

5. **Industries We Serve Section:**
   - New section below services showing key industries we work with:
     - Real Estate
     - E-Commerce
     - Healthcare
     - Education
     - Food & Restaurants
   - Each with an icon and 1-line description.

6. **Lead Magnet Popup (Email Capture):**
   - Add a scroll or exit-intent popup:
     - Heading: "Free Guide: Top 10 Digital Marketing Strategies for 2025"
     - Subheading: "Enter your email to get instant access"
     - Fields: Email + Download Now button
   - Add email submissions to a file or send to inbox.

7. **Advanced Content Protection:**
   - Prevent right-click, copy, print screen (via JS).
   - Prevent blog text selection and copying.
   - Optional watermark overlay on portfolio images.

8. **SEO and Analytics Enhancements:**
   - Add meta title and description to each page.
   - Add Open Graph and Twitter meta tags for social sharing.
   - Add Google Analytics (or Plausible) code.
   - Use schema markup for services and blog.

9. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Compress images for faster load.
   - Reduce spacing on mobile for hero and team sections.
   - Adjust size of floating WhatsApp button for mobile view.

Final Output:
The updated website should maintain the current design theme (blue) and feel, but look more premium, lead-generating, mobile-optimized, and content-protected.
